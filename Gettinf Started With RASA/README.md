# The Starter (Default) Bot

The starter example is designed to help you see and run the out-of-the-box working chatbot.

## How to get the Starter example?

pip install rasa

python -W ignore -m rasa init --no-prompt

The rasa init command creates all the files that a Rasa project needs and trains a simple bot on some sample data. If you leave out the --no-prompt flag you will be asked some questions about how you want your project to be set up.


### Whatâ€™s inside this example?

This example contains some training data and the main files needed to build an assistant on your local machine. The formbot consists of the following files:

    data/nlu.md contains training examples for the NLU model
    data/stories.md contains training stories for the Core model
    config.yml contains the model configuration
    domain.yml contains the domain of the assistant
       

### How to use this example?    

    Train a Rasa model containing the Rasa NLU and Rasa Core models by running:

    python -W ignore -m rasa train

    The model will be stored in the /models directory as a zipped file.

    In another window:

    python -W ignore -m rasa shell --quiet --cors * -m models 

    This will load the assistant in your command line for you to chat.
    

### Sample Chat
